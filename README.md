## üìú Introduction

In our modern world, effective waste management is crucial for sustainable living. **TempatSampah-IOT** addresses this need by offering a real-time monitoring system that helps users track waste levels. This system uses the ESP32 microcontroller to gather data, which is then sent to Firebase for storage and processing. Users receive notifications through platforms like Discord and Telegram, ensuring they stay informed.

## üåü Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track waste levels instantly.
- **Multi-Platform Notifications**: Get alerts via Discord and Telegram.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate dashboard.
- **Data Visualization**: Charts to display waste trends.
- **Environmentally Friendly**: Supports smart city initiatives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **ESP32**: The microcontroller that gathers data.
- **Firebase**: A real-time database for storing and retrieving data.
- **Node.js**: Server-side logic to handle requests and manage data.
- **Chart.js**: For data visualization.
- **Bootstrap**: To create a responsive user interface.
- **Discord Bot**: For sending notifications.
- **Telegram Bot**: For additional notification options.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: To measure waste levels accurately.

## üì• Installation

To set up **TempatSampah-IOT**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prit006/TempatSampah-IOT.git
   cd TempatSampah-IOT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the Node.js folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project.
   - Add your Firebase configuration in the project.

4. **Upload Code to ESP32**:
   Use the Arduino IDE to upload the ESP32 code.

5. **Run the Server**:
   Start the Node.js server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

6. **Access the Dashboard**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìä Usage

Once installed, you can start monitoring waste levels. The ultrasonic sensor will measure the height of waste in the bin. The data will be sent to Firebase, and you will receive notifications when the bin reaches a certain threshold. 

### Dashboard Features

- **Live Updates**: See real-time data on waste levels.
- **Notification Settings**: Customize your alert preferences.
- **Historical Data**: Access past data to analyze trends.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to the waste surface.
2. **Data Transmission**: The ESP32 sends this data to Firebase.
3. **Data Processing**: Node.js handles requests and processes data from Firebase.
4. **User Notifications**: Users receive alerts via Discord and Telegram based on set thresholds.
5. **Data Visualization**: The dashboard displays real-time data and trends using Chart.js.
